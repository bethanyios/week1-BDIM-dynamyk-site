## Motivation

Our purpose was to learn as much as we could.

## Our process

### First steps

We began by closing our laptops, looking through the [design brief](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-1/project.md), talking through our ideas for the site and looking for consensus on key design questions.

One of these decisions was to design **mobile-first** and then design for other devices (principally desktop) via _progressive enhancement_. For us, this looked like responsive elements and a media query with a min-width of 600px.

To make sure we had a good shared understanding of the overall structure of the wesbite, and to avoid having to deal with too mnay conflicts, we produced a sketch of the wireframe:

We then mob-built the HTML structure, trying to make it as semantic as possible. This resulted in our [first commit](https://github.com/fac18/dynamyk-site/commit/c0761cecbdcbc8130a51e0656e847fde903e5cf4) beyond initialisation. Only after that did we begin to work on different features in pairs, with branches.

### Stretch goals

We landed on some stretch goals that we wanted to implement beyond the key design requirements given by the user stories. Some of these were:

- [ ] Making our profiles into on-click flip-cards
- [ ] Integrating the contact form to fill a Google Sheet
- [ ] Including a portfolio of invented previous work
- [ ] Including a section with testimonials from previous clients
- [x] Installing a parallax (non-scrolling) background 

As you can see, we didn't manage all of them, but they represent design ambitions we'd like to fulfil and likely would have with more time. Shoot for the moon!

### Git flow

Mastering git flow was a key problem we had to manage. Things

## Tracking our progress

We used this list to keep track of whether we were meeting the design brief specified by the user stories.

On visiting the site, client/site user should find the following to be true:

- [ ] on visiting the site, immediately see a headline about our team
- [ ] immediately get a concise description of what you have to offer me
- [ ]
